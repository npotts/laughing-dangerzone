===================

Collection of various scripts that do some useful stuff: maybe.

Maybe they just melt your CPU.

They could do something functional.

They might just be short _gists_ that I actually want to keep.

In all cases: user beware




Collection
==========

1. [pyTime](/pytime "Pytime") - A sometimes handy desktop clock based off wxpython and python 2.x that displays the time from various timezones. Comes in really handy when on world-wide scientific programs where you need to know UTC, wherever you are, and wherever home is so you can keep up with the significant other.
1. [tmux-colors](/tmux-colors "Tmux Colors") - A simple script I got off some forum somewhere that prints out all the tmux color combinations based on your $TERM and other parameters
1. [hdhomerun](/hdhomerun "Ub3r simple HDhomerun") Very simple GUI that has channel names rather than numbers and subchannels.  Makes the wife happy
