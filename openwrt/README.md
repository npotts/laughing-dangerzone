OpenWRT helpers
===============

I am the proud owner of a RouterStation Pro ([rspro](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/routerstation.pro "rspro")) from Ubiquity, and it runs openwrt. I often update it, and often over tftp.  This uses the default IP in the rspro so I can update the OS from a custom image.  Otherwise it is a collection of helper scripts

Requirements
------------

+ OpenWRT
+ atftp
